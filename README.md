## What is this?
This is a bundle of tools designed to make sourcing posts and images easy for [e621](https://e621.net). There are three main parts:

* on-site plans
* [image-data comparison](https://e621.net/extensions/image_compare)
* [post BVASer](https://e621.net/extensions/upload_bvas)

### on-site plans
The on-site plans include utilities for uploading and verifying the source of post. It includes three parts: a convenient link to upload an image to e621, an automatic image hasher that checks if an image was uploaded to e621, and a button to copy a posts' description.

### image-data comparison
The image-data comparison tool is something that could be used to find the subtle differences between image files. It is most useful for checking if there are unnoticeable compression artifacts in an image.

### post BVASer
The post BVASer is a recreation of [a tool](https://e621.net/forum/show/87369) originally made by Munkelzahn. It will replace a post on e621 with a new image that has superior quality. It will copy all information from the old post into a new one.
